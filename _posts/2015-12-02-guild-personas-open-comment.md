title: Guild Personas Open for Comment
---

Beginning today, the *beta* version of the [Guild Personas]({{ site.url }}/artisan_roles) are open for comment from all of Pillar. The document will remain in beta for approximately one week. The *alpha* version of the document was released to **Diversity @ Pillar** several weeks ago. This version reflects some of the modifications and recommendations made by that group.
  
# Our Expectations
We expect this round of commenting to produce many questions. In fact, we are encouraging each and every one of **YOU** (yes *you*) to provide feedback and ask those questions. One of the deliverables of this process will be a FAQ which will document the questions that people put forth and the resulting answers. 

# How Can I Contribute?
If you're so inclined, we'll take pull requests on the [guild-docs repository](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs). You can also ask questions by [opening an issue](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues). Be sure to check out other people'e issues and see if they match your own questions. Threaded conversations are possible and encouraged on the Issues tab.

Other conventional means of communication are also possible. You can drop an email to *mastercraftsmen@pillartechnology.com*. We'll make sure your questions get captured and answered along with the rest of them.

If none of the previous options meets your needs, please utilize the 'Disqus' comments sections at the bottom of the page.  Please leave your thoughts and/or questions within the comment section and we will aggregate with all other methods of submission.

# Future State
This definition of artisan roles is designed as a starting point for building out a comprehensive guild system at Pillar. As such, these definitions encompass the 'what'. The 'how' of moving from one role to another will be following in the footsteps of these definitions. This first step, of getting clarity around these roles, is just the beginning. The [value stories]({{ site.url }}/artisan_roles/value_stories.html) around these roles may help to answer a few of the 'why' behind roles.
